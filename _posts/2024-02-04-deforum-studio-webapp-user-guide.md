Getting Started with the Deforum Studio Web App

# Welcome to Deforum Studio!

Deforum Studio is a user-friendly, easy-to-use web-based service that allows you to create amazing AI visuals.

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the Animate page using the menu on the left side of the web page.

## Creating Your Animation
- **Prompt:** Type your prompt into the prompt box. Here are a few considerations:
  - *Negative Prompts:* Advanced users can guide AI with `--neg` followed by a negative prompt.
  - *Prompt Length:* Be mindful not to exceed the limit for smooth generation.
  - *Prompt Weights:* Refine emphasis with parentheses and manipulate weights for nuanced control.

### Example Prompts
- `(Cats eating sushi:1.3)` on a beach being watched by dogs
- `(((Cats eating sushi)))` on a beach being watched by dogs

**User Guidance:** Experiment with varied weight values to gauge their impact on generated content.

### Prompt Style
- Choose a prompt style from the drop-down menu or use the filter. There are 75 preset styles, including options for none or random.

### Motion Presets
- Select a motion preset from the drop-down menu or use the filter. Choose from 50 presets, including none or random.

### Slow Motion
- Check the slow-motion box to slow down your animation, adding a silky smooth effect while extending it to 30 seconds (using slow motion incurs an additional 0.2 credits)

### Privacy
- Adjust prompt visibility to private. Only pro-subscribers can hide animations from the community feed. Configure these options in your user settings.

## The Animation Process
- After starting your animation, preview your generations as they run, updating every 20 frames. You can cancel during the preview and receive a refund based on the frames generated so far.

## Final Animation Options
- **Download Video:** Download the final video.
- **Download Frames:** Download individual frames.
- **Report:** Flag issues to admins or report NSFW content.
- **Delete:** Remove your video from your library and the community feed.

## My Recent Animations
- View your 5 most recent animations, including those being processed. Click on any animation to load it in the video preview window above, along with your prompt and settings. Rerun your generation or modify your prompt or any settings you had used previously. You can also load any animation stored in library aka My Animations.
