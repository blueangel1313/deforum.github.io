## **Learn how to use our new Discord bot ðŸ¤–, a straightforward and user-friendly introduction to Deforum.**

## **Getting Started**

We're excited to have you on board to explore the capabilities of Deforum. To initiate the AI animation process, use the command `/animate`. After adding your prompt, use the `â‡¥` (tab) key to navigate to the next box, where a menu will automatically appear. Once you select an option from the menu, the cursor will advance to the next box for your convenience.

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 10px;">

## **Navigation Instructions**

`/animate` Type this command in the Discord chat to start the animation process.

`prompt` Enter the text or phrase you wish to animate.

`prompt_style` Use the Tab key to navigate to this box after entering your prompt. A menu will appear automatically to choose the prompt style. Prompt styles will add keywords to your prompt changing the artstyle.

`motion_preset` After selecting the prompt style, the cursor will advance to this box, where a new menu will automatically show up for motion preset selection.

`aspect_ratio` After selecting the prompt style, the cursor will advance to this box, after choosing a motion preset. A new menu will appear containing the aspect ratio options: Square, Landscape, and Portrait.

This sequence allows precise customization of your AI-generated animations by navigating through each stage seamlessly. The bot's functionality is optimized for creating AI-powered animations based on text prompts.

## **Confirmation Message**
After submitting your prompt, the bot sends a confirmation message acknowledging the reception of your animation request. A second message will be sent to your DMs when the animation process begins and youâ€™ll see a `Details` button appear.

## **Web App**

Clicking The prieview button redirects you to our dedicated web app designed for a comprehensive overview of the animation's development. The final video will be posted to the discord channel. 

**Progress Overview:** The web app provides an overview of the video's progress, detailing all generation settings. This includes the total wait time, generation time, chosen prompt, prompt style, and selected motion preset.

**Video Preview:** Users can view the ongoing progress of their animation frame by frame within the web app. You can also download individual frames. This allows for a detailed analysis of the animation's development. 

**Completed Preview:** The web app also displays a periodically updated video player, typically every 20 frames. This provides a smoother preview of the animation's progression.

**Final Video and Details:** Upon completion of the animation job, the final video is showcased within the web app. 

**Automatic Posting:** The completed video is automatically posted back to Discord for easy access.

By offering a detailed overview of the animation's progression and completion, including the settings used, progress status, and final video preview, the web app ensures an enhanced user experience and facilitates a clear understanding of the animation generation process.

## **Advanced Prompting Options**

### **Prompt Length and Discord Bot Limitations**
When crafting prompts for Discord bot-generated animations, it's crucial to be mindful of the prompt's length. The Discord bot has a maximum prompt length limitation. Exceeding this limit may result in the failure of the generation process. Shorter, focused prompts are advisable for smoother and more successful bot-generated animations.

### **Using Negative Prompts**
For more nuanced prompts, advanced users can employ negative prompts to guide AI generation. By appending --neg followed by your negative prompt, you can influence the direction or avoid specific themes within the output. 

```
cats eating sushi --neg dogs, cows, sheep
```

### **Prompt Weights for Emphasis**
Refine specific words or phrases within the prompt using parentheses. Elevate importance through extra parentheses, like (word) for marginal emphasis and ((word)) for extra emphasis.

### **Manipulating Weight Values**

Adjust emphasis by applying weight values within the parentheses. 
For instance:

```
(your prompt:1.5) increases emphasis of the default weight.
```
```
(your prompt:-.5) reduces emphasis of the default weight.
```

Example Prompts:
```
(Cats eating sushi:1.3) on a beach being watched by dogs
```
```
(((Cats eating sushi))) on a beach being watched by dogs
```

User Guidance: Experiment with varied weight values in prompts to assess their influence on the content generated. Altering weights influences the AI's focus, providing control over content without modifying the entire prompt.
